*****WARNING*****
*****************
This modification should be (as in designed and tested to be) safe to use, but as with any third-party modification I advise you to back up your save file.

***Installation***
ManaMason depends on Bezel Mod Loader. If you haven't, please install a release for your game version, grab it from here: https://github.com/gemforce-team/BezelModLoader
Make sure to read the readme!

After that, simply drop ManaMason-*-for-*-.swf into the Mods folder. It will be loaded the next time you start up the game.
